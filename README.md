# cdc_health_data
Data Analysis Project on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System# CDC Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes public health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to uncover trends in health-related factors across different demographics and locations in the United States.

## Data Source
The dataset is obtained via the CDC API: [CDC Public Health Data](https://data.cdc.gov/). It contains health metrics categorized by year, location, demographic factors (e.g., sex, income, race, and education), and health conditions (e.g., obesity, physical activity, chronic diseases).

## Objectives
- Retrieve and preprocess public health data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.
- Visualize key health metrics by demographic and geographical distribution.
- Analyze health trends over time.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is fetched from the CDC API and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Data types are converted, missing values handled, and categorical variables optimized for memory efficiency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summarizing key statistics and distributions.
   - Identifying trends in health-related factors across demographics.
   - Comparing health conditions across U.S. states.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Boxplots for comparing metrics by demographics.
   - Line plots for observing trends over time.
   - Bar charts for geographical comparisons.

## Key Findings
- **Health trends vary significantly across different states and demographics.**
- **Obesity and physical activity levels show clear disparities based on income and education.**
- **Some locations exhibit higher or lower health metrics due to socioeconomic or regional factors.**

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CDC API for data retrieval

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook cdc_data_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Integrating machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Expanding analysis to additional health indicators.
- Automating API data updates for real-time insights.
